Each benchmark:
1. Allocates buffer of specified size
2. Fills with pseudo-random data (prevents compression)
3. Runs tight loop with unrolled operations
4. Uses compiler barriers to prevent optimization
5. Measures throughput via SetBytesProcessed
6. Reports in GB/s

## Key Implementation Details

### Working Set Sizing

Critical insight: Working set determines which cache level is tested.

| Target | Size | Working Set | Rationale |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------|
| L1 | 32 KB | 16 KB | Fits in L1, all data stays resident |
| L2 | 1 MB | 256 KB | Exceeds L1, fits in L2 |
| L3 | 32 MB | 8 MB | Exceeds L2, fits in L3 |
| DRAM | Unbounded | 64 MB | Exceeds L3, DRAM-only |

### Loop Unrolling (8-way)

Without unrolling: Each operation stalls waiting for previous operation (~40ns)

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    dummy ^= p[i];  // Wait 40ns for load
}
// Bandwidth: 1 op / 40ns = ~25 MB/s
```

With unrolling: CPU keeps 8 operations in flight

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < n; i += 8) {
    dummy ^= p[i];     // Start op 1
    dummy ^= p[i+1];   // Start op 2 (op 1 finishing)
    dummy ^= p[i+2];   // Start op 3 (op 1 complete)
    ...               // ops 4-8
}
// Bandwidth: 8 ops / 5ns = ~50 GB/s (with prefetching)
```

### Compiler Barriers

Multiple barriers prevent unwanted optimization:

1. `compiler_barrier()`: `asm volatile("" ::: "memory")`
   - Tells compiler memory might change
   - Prevents reordering
   - Lightweight

2. `benchmark::DoNotOptimize()`
   - Prevents dead-code elimination of results
   - Uses result in compiler-opaque way

3. `volatile` pointers (optional)
   - Stronger barrier
   - Not needed with above methods

### Access Pattern: Stride-1 (Sequential)

Why sequential?
- Triggers hardware prefetching
- Measures throughput (not latency)
- Best-case scenario
- Consistent baseline

Hardware behavior:
```
Access 0: Load from DRAM (~250 ns)
Access 1: Load from prefetch buffer (~1 ns)
Access 2: Load from prefetch buffer (~1 ns)
...
Access N: Load from cache (~1 ns)

Average: (250 + (N-1)*1) / N ≈ O(1) with prefetching
```

## Performance Results (Sample Run)

### Hardware

```
Run on (16 X 5343 MHz CPU s)
CPU Caches:
  L1 Data 32 KiB (x8)
  L1 Instruction 32 KiB (x8)
  L2 Unified 1024 KiB (x8)
  L3 Unified 32768 KiB (x1)
```

### Results

```
Load Operations:
  L1: 102.68 GB/s  (best case for reads)
  L2: 80.43 GB/s   (78% of L1, ~8% penalty)
  L3: 75.87 GB/s   (74% of L1, ~26% penalty)
  DRAM: 50.36 GB/s (49% of L1, ~50% penalty)

Store Operations:
  L1: 157.77 GB/s  (stores are more efficient than loads)
  L2: 156.41 GB/s  (maintains efficiency)
  L3: 129.84 GB/s  (82% of L1, acceptable)
  DRAM: 24.66 GB/s (16% of L1, significant penalty)

Mixed Load/Store:
  L1: 304.89 GB/s  (>2x individual ops, dual-issue)
  L2: 156.10 GB/s  (load + store bandwidth combined)
  L3: 131.28 GB/s  (similar to store pattern)
  DRAM: 30.52 GB/s (slightly better than DRAM store alone)
```

### Key Observations

1. **Store > Load on L1-L3**: Write operations use write-combining buffers more efficiently
2. **Mixed >> Individual**: Load and store ports execute in parallel
3. **Significant drop at DRAM**: Main memory is the bottleneck
4. **Prefetching effect**: Sequential access achieves high throughput at all levels

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Establish Baseline

```bash
bazel run //benchmarks:cache_throughput_benchmark -- --benchmark_min_time=3s
```

Gives you hardware ceiling for:
- Sequential load throughput
- Sequential store throughput
- Mixed operation throughput

### Example 2: Analyze Column Operation

```bash
# Run cache baseline
bazel run //benchmarks:cache_throughput_benchmark -- --benchmark_filter="Cache_Mixed_L3"

# Run column operation
bazel run //benchmarks:column_benchmark -- --benchmark_filter="BM_Int32_Add"

# Calculate utilization
# If column operation achieves 60 GB/s on 8MB data:
# Utilization = 60 / 130 (L3 mixed baseline) = 46% (reasonable)
```

### Example 3: Detect Bottleneck

```bash
# Profile with perf
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses \
  bazel run //benchmarks:column_benchmark -- BM_Int32_Add

# Analyze results:
# If cache-miss rate < 5% and throughput < 50% of baseline:
#   Bottleneck is COMPUTE, not MEMORY
# If cache-miss rate > 10%:
#   Bottleneck is MEMORY (cache misses)
# If throughput near baseline and IPC > 2:
#   Operating near hardware limits
```

## Integration Points

### With column_benchmark

Column operations should be compared against cache baselines:

1. Identify working set size
2. Find matching cache level
3. Compare throughput
4. Calculate utilization percentage

### With column_reduction_benchmark

Reductions are compute-bound (sequential dependencies):

1. Don't expect to hit cache throughput ceiling
2. Use cache baseline to verify not memory-bottleneck
3. Focus optimization on ILP and instruction counts

### With kernel_fusion_benchmark

Loop fusion should reduce memory traffic:

1. Compare naive vs. fused cache_throughput baseline
2. Measure cache-miss reduction
3. Estimate bandwidth savings

## Validation

✓ Documentation: 1,700 lines across 5 guides
✓ Build: Successfully compiles with bazel
✓ Runtime: Successfully runs and produces meaningful results

```

## Design Decisions

### Why Sequential Access?

- Hardware prefetching works optimally
- Measures throughput ceiling (not latency)
- Consistent baseline across operations
- Easier to reason about

### Why 8-Way Unrolling?

- Modern CPUs can keep 4-8 loads in flight
- Hidden latency enables throughput measurement
- Standard optimization practice
- Balance between coverage and readability

### Why Multiple Cache Levels?

- Shows cache hierarchy behavior
- Identifies where performance drops
- Helps explain column operation behavior
- Establishes ceiling for each level

### Why Mixed Operations?

- Most realistic pattern (read + write)
- Demonstrates dual-issue capability
- Important for column transformations
- Shows that load/store can overlap

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements (not implemented):

1. **SIMD throughput**: Measure with AVX-512 operations
2. **Random access**: Compare stride-1 vs. random
3. **Multi-threaded**: Measure cache coherency effects
4. **NUMA**: Test on multi-socket systems
5. **Prefetch analysis**: Explicit prefetch vs. automatic
6. **Write patterns**: Write-combining vs. write-through

These would require additional benchmarks and analysis framework.

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Profile first, optimize second**: Establish baseline before improving
2. **Measure what matters**: Bandwidth in GB/s, not just operations
3. **Use compiler barriers correctly**: Prevent unwanted optimization
4. **Consider ILP**: Loop unrolling for throughput, not just speed
5. **Validate on hardware**: Results vary by CPU generation
6. **Document assumptions**: Stride-1, warm cache, single-threaded

2. **Methodology framework** for analyzing application performance
3. **Integration point** for understanding column operation efficiency

Use these measurements to understand whether column operations are:
- Memory-bound (good utilization of available bandwidth)
