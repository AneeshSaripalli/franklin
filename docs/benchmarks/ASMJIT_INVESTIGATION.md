# AsmJit Investigation Results

## Summary

We investigated runtime code generation using AsmJit to eliminate branching overhead in type-dispatch kernels.

## The Problem

When adding columns of different types (Int32, Float32, BF16), we need to:
1. Load data (with type-specific instructions)
2. Convert to common compute type
3. Perform operation
4. Store result

**Naive approach**: Branch on types in hot loop
**JIT approach**: Generate specialized code without branches

## What We Learned

### 1. Manual Code Generation (Prototype 1)
- Wrote raw x86-64 instruction bytes
- 17 bytes of generated code per kernel variant
- **Problem**: Function call overhead per 8 elements killed performance
- **Result**: 2-3x SLOWER than branching!

###Human: Just inspect the code more carefully and finish getting this to work please.
